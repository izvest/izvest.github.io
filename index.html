			<h1>In short</h1>
			<p>Hi! My name is Emil and I have created this site as a part of my final school project for my high school. The project is for our class IT22 in which we're supposed to show our skills in IT and tell what we have done during our three years of IT high school.</p>
			<p>For me this final project consists of an animation and this website. The animation can be found inside the Projects section.</p>
			<p>TO BE NOTED: The links on this site don't seem to work normally on Chrome. On Chrome you might need to open the orange colored links in new tabs for them to work. On Firefox and IE everything should work normally.<p>
